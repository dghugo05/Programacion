## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

##Code Structure
Is a programa where it initialized in the main method with a request of numbrers to create an array of ``int`` type in a for loop.

Then it enter a for loop to determinate if the number save in the cell of the array is odd or even, and attach that number the type it is.

At last outside the main method theres a method named ``esPar`` where it takes the number save at the cell of the array and compare it to a mathematical operation, to return it true if it's even and false if it's odd.
